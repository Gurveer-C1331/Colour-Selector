# Colour-Selector
The Colour Selector is an application made using the Electron framework to allow a user to input colour using a colour picker, entering hex, rgb colour codes. The functionality is similar to other general colour selectors. For example, if the hex code is entered, the user will see a visual representation of the colour, along with the rgb value. This project helped me understand the basic functions of using Electron to allow me to create a basic application. This project also allowed me to practice basic javascript, css, html concepts learnt using various tutorials on Youtube. Another concept I applied was the use of packages. The colour picker in this application was made possible by the "a-color-picker" package, by using this I learnt how to install and use a package in order to complete the application.

Concepts:
- Basic Use of Electron Framework
- Basic Javascript, CSS, HTML Concepts
- Installing and Using a Package
