# Colour-Selector
The Colour Selector is an application made using the Electron framework. This application allows a user to input colours using a colour picker, entering a HEX, RGB colour code. The functionality is similar to other generic colour selectors. For example, if the HEX code is entered, the user will see a visual representation of the colour, along with the RGB value. This project helped me understand the basics of using Electron to allow me to create a simple application. This project also allowed me to practice basic JavaScript, CSS, HTML concepts learnt using various tutorials on Youtube. Another concept I applied was the use of packages. The colour picker in this application was made possible by the "a-color-picker" package. By using this, I learnt how to install and use a package to complete the application.

**Made using Electron, need to install Electron as dev dependency and make changes to package.json so "main.js" is the Main Process**

**"a-color-picker" package was used, install as dev dependency**

Concepts/Skills Applied:
- Basic Use of Electron Framework
- Basic Javascript, CSS, HTML Concepts
- Installing and Using a Package
